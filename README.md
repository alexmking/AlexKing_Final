Pokedex Project from Java class
This is my final project for my Intro to Java class a few years ago. It simulates a 'Pokedex' program which finds all Pokemon that match whatever combination of 
criteria the user specifies. For example: It could find all Pokemon that are above 4ft tall, weigh under 100 lbs and are fully evolved. 
It's important to note this code is by no means 'efficient' or representative of the programmer I am today. When I built this project I hadn't even learned OOP yet.
However I chose to include it in my resume because it represents one of the catalysts for my love of programming.
Eventually I plan to revisit this project and polish it up using everything I've learned since I took this class.
